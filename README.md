## Installation

Download MySQL workbench and run `schema.sql` to create an `employee_db` database. Then, run the script `seeds.sql` to populate the database with sample data. From here you can overwrite the file to initially populate the database. You can forego creating seeds there and use the actual CLI to enter information.

## Usage

use the command `node server.js` to start the CLI. From there you can use the arrow keys to navigate the prompts from Inquirer to execute commands as you wish.
